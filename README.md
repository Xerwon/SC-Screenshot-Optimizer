# SC Screenshot Optimizer

A lightweight PowerShell script that automatically optimizes your **Star Citizen** screenshots.  
Whenever a new screenshot appears in one of your screenshot folders, it’s automatically **converted to WebP**, optionally **resized**, and the **original file is deleted**.

Perfect for sharing on Discord, uploading to UEX, or archiving your gameplay shots efficiently.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Watches any number of screenshot folders (LIVE, PTU, EPTU, etc.)
- Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`
- Converts to **WebP (quality 78–85%)**
- Optional: scale down to a defined max width (e.g., 2560 px)
- Deletes the original file after successful conversion
- Works on **Windows PowerShell 5.1** and **PowerShell 7+**
- Requires only **ImageMagick** — no extra modules or dependencies

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [ImageMagick 7.x](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)  
  After installation, check it works by running:
  ```powershell
  magick -version

---

## 📦 Installation

Place the script, e.g.:

`C:\Tools\SC\SC_Screenshot_Optimizer.ps1`


Open the script and set your screenshot paths:

`[string[]]$Sources = @(
"D:\StarCitizen\LIVE\screenshots",
"D:\StarCitizen\PTU\screenshots"
)`

(Optional) adjust image quality or max width:

`[int]$MaxWidth = 2560`

`[int]$Quality  = 82`

---

## ▶️ Manual Run

`powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\SC\SC_Screenshot_Optimizer.ps1"`

Keep the PowerShell window open — it will poll the folder every 2 seconds and optimize new screenshots.

 ---

## 🚀 Autostart (Recommended)

You can make the optimizer run automatically every time you log in to Windows —
no need to keep PowerShell open manually.

### 🔧 Install the Autostart Task


1️⃣ Open PowerShell as Administrator

2️⃣ Change directory

`cd "C:\Tools\SC"`


3️⃣ Unblock downloaded scripts

`Get-ChildItem . | Unblock-File`


4️⃣ Run the installer

`.\install-task.ps1 -ScriptPath "C:\Tools\SC\SC_Screenshot_Optimizer.ps1"`


✅ This creates the Windows scheduled task
“SC Screenshot Optimizer” that runs automatically on every login — hidden and elevated.

### 🧪 🧪 Verify & Test — What to expect
✅ Verify (after installing the task)

1️⃣ Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run:
`schtasks /Query /TN "SC Screenshot Optimizer" /V /FO LIST`

You should see:

- `TaskName: \SC Screenshot Optimizer`
- `Next Run Time: At log on` (or a concrete upcoming time)
- `Run as User: <your user>`
- `Logon Mode: Interactive/Background` (wording varies)
- `Last Run Result: 0` (this means “success”)

You should NOT see:

- `ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.` → Wrong -ScriptPath in install.
- `Last Run Result: 0x1` or other non-zero codes → Usually quoting/permissions/path issues.
- A different user in `Run as User` (e.g., SYSTEM) unless you intended that.

▶️ Test (start it manually)
1️⃣ Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run:
`schtasks /Run /TN "SC Screenshot Optimizer"`

You should see:

- The command returns quickly (no error).
- Your script starts in the background (no visible window due to `-WindowStyle Hidden`).
- The log file is created/updated:
    - If your script logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`:
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SC_Screenshot_Optimizer.log`
- If you changed it to the script folder, check there instead.

- Log contains lines like:
  - `Polling started: D:\StarCitizen\PTU\screenshots, ...`
  - `OK : <name>.webp` after you create a fresh JPG/PNG in a watched folder.

You should NOT see:

A blocking PowerShell window that never returns (task runs hidden; the query/ run commands should return).

No log entry at all after you drop a new screenshot into the watched folder.

Repeated FAIL: or DEL FAIL: lines (indicates conversion/permissions issues).

.jpg files staying forever alongside .webp after a fresh screenshot (means conversion or delete failed).

🧰 Quick live test (without launching the game)

Make a dummy file in a watched folder:

Set-Content -Path "D:\StarCitizen\PTU\screenshots\_test.jpg" -Value "x"


Wait up to 2–3 seconds (polling interval).

Expected result:

_test.webp appears

_test.jpg is deleted

Log shows OK : _test.webp

If not:

Check that the folder path in your optimizer script matches the one you’re testing.

Run magick -version in PowerShell to ensure ImageMagick is on PATH.

Open the log and look for FAIL messages (quoting them in an issue helps).

🚨 Common pitfalls & fixes

No log file appears

You’re looking in the wrong place (different user account or different log path).

The task didn’t actually start. Re-run schtasks /Run /TN ... and query status.

If you run the task as SYSTEM, the log may be under the SYSTEM profile.

“Last Run Result: 0x1”

Usually bad quoting or wrong ScriptPath. Reinstall with the exact path.

Ensure the script isn’t blocked: Unblock-File C:\Tools\SC\SC_Screenshot_Optimizer.ps1.

Conversion doesn’t happen

Verify the file extension is supported (.jpg, .jpeg, .png).

Ensure magick is available: magick -version.

Check the script’s $Sources actually include the folder you’re testing.

Files exist but never get processed

Your script uses a polling loop (default 2 seconds). Give it a moment.

Check timestamps: files are only reprocessed if source is newer than target.

Try with a new file: create or copy a fresh .jpg to the folder.

Task created under the wrong user

Reinstall from an elevated PowerShell opened under the intended account.

In Task Scheduler, confirm “Run only when user is logged on” (for debugging) and “Run with highest privileges.”

### 🧹 Uninstall

`.\uninstall-task.ps1 -StopRunning`

✅ Stops and removes the task completely.

## 🧪 Example Results
Original	Optimized (WebP)	File Size

`14 MB (JPG)	1.1 MB (WebP 82 %)	− 92 %`

`18 MB (PNG)	1.5 MB (WebP 82 %)	− 91 %`

Visually identical — ideal for web, Discord, and report uploads.
